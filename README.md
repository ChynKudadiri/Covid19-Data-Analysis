# Covid19-Data-Analysis
In this project, I use SQL for data exploration and Tableu for data visualization. The dataset used is Covid19 data worldwide from 24 February 2020 to 20 February 2023. The dataset can be downloaded on https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

Data exploration is carried out by analyzing data to answer business questions such as the following:
- How many total cases of covid19 have occurred in Indonesia today?
- How many deaths due to covid19 in Indonesia today?
- How many additional cases of Covid-19 today in Indonesia?
- How many total cases of covid19 in the world per day?
- How many deaths due to covid19 in the world?
- Which country has the highest total of covid19 cases?
- How many total covid19 cases for each continent?
- How many total cases of Covid-19 have been added in the world per day?

Data visualization using Tableu can be seen here : [Covid-19 Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid_Dashboard_16772317883850/COVIDDASHBOARD?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
